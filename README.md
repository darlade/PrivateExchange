# Nature of our service
We are a completely private exchange, there is no KYC and thus no refunds. This is because we do not store anything on you except for your IP and Monero Address. Once the transaction is completed this data is deleted.

If you make an error in input I.e. wrong address, incorrect coin amount etc. This is an error on your end.
